# Three-phase-inverter-with-induction-motor
The aim of this project is to let the students to revolve the theoretical knowledge gained from many courses
such as power electronics, drives, microprocessor, and control to a real application.
In this project, the students will develop a variable speed drive system based on three-phase induction motor.
The Volt/Hertz and stator voltage frequency technique will be utilized to keep the maximum torque without saturation.
A microcontroller is used to generate the gating signals of the switches of the three phase inverters to adjust the voltage
and the frequency of the motor for the corresponding desired speed. In addition, the power electronics converter and
its associated control circuits will be developed on a PCB. After developing the drive system, the static characteristics
should be investigated and the effect of loading will be recorded.
